// what is the linked List?

// - a linked list is data structure where each element (called a node) contains two parts:

// - DATA: the value or information stored
// - Pointer: a reference to the next node in the sequence

// unlike array linked list don't store element in contigouse memory location, instead each node points to the next one forming a chain, the last one typically points to null, indicating the end of the list

// 1 => Remove Linked List Elements

// Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.
